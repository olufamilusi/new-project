         Final Class Real life Interview Questions


1-boot process; boot config file
1-Boot process: there’s 4 phases in the boot process:
 A-Firmware phase:  Bios run the post (power on self-test) to initialize the system hardware then discover the MBR (master boot record)which load the boot loader phase.
B-Boot loader phase: the grub takes the kernel from the /boot then decompress it and place it in to the memory based configuration file /boot/grub2/grub.cfg then load the kernel phase.
C-kernel phase: the kernel load required drivers from the initrd.img and start the first process (systemd) rhel 7/8   or (initd) rhel6 
D-initialization phase: system takes control of the kernel and enable all the services then start the runlevel.

 2-difference between rhel6/7/8

 
   Selinux is a Linux kernel security module that provides a support access control policies.
     It has 3 modes:enforcing ,permissive and disabled 

4-how do you build a webserver? do you have experience on building web-server
-	Download the package 
-	Start and enable the service 
-	Edit the /var/www/html/index.txt file
-	If firewall and selinux are enabled add the service and the port to the firewall level.
-	Restart the service 
-	Try to access the webserver using the curl command or using the ip on  a browser to verify.

5-how do you harden your system

To harden my system I  will need to:
-secure user accounts : put  strong user id ,set password to expire, increase the length of the password ,increase the complexity of the password(/etc/security/pwquality.conf )rhel 7/8 (etc/pam.d/passwd.auth) rhel 6.
-disable the user root remotely login 
-remove unwanted packages
-Stop unused services
-Check on listening ports
-secure ssh configuration by maping shh login to a different port.
-enable firewall (iptables, firewalld)
-Enable   SElinux

-restart the service 
Note :you can verify by using “chronyc sources” command 



9-how do you increase system performance

To increase system performance , I will need to use tuned tool or manage system process
-tuned is a system used to increase  performance
It has different profiles and you should activate the profile that match your server.
-	Second I will need to  manage the processes running on the server by nicing or renicing processes .
-	Nice value will decrease the priority of a process 
-	Decreasing the swap value will increase the system  performance.

10-patching process
A-	Prepatching :
-create a change 
-send communication 
-server version (physical or virtual)
-backup the config files (/etc/fstab,  /etc/sysconfig/network ,/etc/resolv.conf)
-check if /var have at least 50% of space 
-check the runlevel (3 is default)
-make sure repo is available 
-take snapshot of the server 
-blackout the server(maintenance mode)
                B-Implementing the patch :
                          -use ansible playbooks wrote by by engineers to patch 
Or
                         -use adhoc command with yum update to patch the server 
                 -Reboot the system 
               C -post patching:
                             -Make sure all the config files are ok 
                             -check runlevel
                             - send communication 


11-how do you create a logical fs from a rawdisk
---create a partition from the raw disk
 -then create physical volumes(pv) from the partitions 
-combine the physical volumes(pv) to create a volume group(vg)
-then slice the volume group to form logical volume (lv)
-Format and permanently mount the lv in /etc/fstab .

12-how do you build nfs client
-	To build an nfs client  ,I will need to install ,start,enable nfs
-	Put the informations in the /etc/export of the host server
-	Create the mount point
-	Mount the share 
-	Mount permanently (/etc/fstab)
-	Mount -a 
 


13-boot process
14-how do you check if server is virtual/physical

-I will use the dmidecode -t system command

15-what is ssh config file and http

-	The ssh config file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config
-	The http config file is /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
16-how do you bootstrap
-	To bootstrap the server I will neeed:
-	-To install the url katello agent
-	-use the key based on the environment 
-	-after registration, I attach a subscription to a registered server

17-what is runlevel 
Runlevel is operation state that is preset in linux .runlevels are numbered 
from 0 to 6 and determine which program can execute when the server boots up.
-runlevel 0 = halt
-runlevel 1 = maintenance mode
-runlevel 2 = single user mode
-runlevel 3= multi user mode with networking but no gui
