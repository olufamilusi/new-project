Sysfs is a pseudo file system provided by the Linux Kernel that exports info about kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers from the kernel device model to user space through virtual files. 
Lsblk: This will list information about block devices. It reads the sysfs to gather information. 
-	a: empty devices
-	b: size info in byte
-	z: print zone model for devices
-	d: skip slave entries.
-	m: print info about device owner, group, and mode of block devices.
-	-l: list devices in a list format.
  

1.	QUESTION: You add an additional hard drive to your physical machine but can’t find it when you log in to your linux system. What do you do?
Run the lsblk command to display the different block devices in the system. If can’t find it, the issue may be that the hard disk was not properly added. 
2.	QUESTION: You create a partition but can’t find it, what do you do? I’ll use partprobe command. It is used to update the kernel partition table without requiring a system reboot. 

3.	QUESTION: What are the 3 layers of LVM: Physical volume, Volume group, Logical volume. 


4.	QUESTION: What are the advantages of using LVM?
LVM is a storage management tool that is used to convert a physical device to a physical volume. You create a new Physical Volume (PV) from the physical storage. Add the PV to the Volume Group (VG) and then extend the Logical Volume (LV). Here are some of its ++:

-	 Dynamic volume resizing:  Logical Volume Manager (LVM) technology allows you to manage and resize logical volumes dynamically while they are still in use.
-	lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/YourVolumeGroup/YourLogicalVolume
-	Allow you to take snapshots. 
-	Easy of management: LVM simplifies disk management by abstracting away physical details. You work with logical volume instead of physical partitions or disks.
-	Flexibility: LVM offers great flexibility in terms of moving and resizing lvs between physical disks and partitions
-	Data migration, data backup and recovery.
-	 Multi-platform support, and more. 

5.	QUESTION: You are asked to unmount a specific logical volume in a system. When you use the umount command, you receive an error that there is a file currently being used. What do you do? 
-	I will use the lsof (list open files) command to identify the processes using that file or directory. 
-	Lsof +D /dev/sdb or fuser -mv /dev/sdb. 
-	Then with sudo kill -9 PID, I will kill the process. 

 Lsof will display all the files that are being used including the user, PID, and more. An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character, etc.
-	 lsof /run: to know what process is using the /run dir. 
-	Lsof -i: Display files associated with Internet connection and ports.
-	Lsof -i tcp :22
-	Lsof /var/log/kern.log: See processes that have opened a file (will provide infos about that file).
-	Lsof -u admin: to display the files admin has opened. 
-	Lsof -p 890: to see how many files the process has opened. 
-	-D search all opened files 
   

5.1	QUESTION: Using the fuser command, you can identify all the processes using sockets. It will display the User, PID, ACCESS, and COMMAND. Then with option like -k (kill), I will kill a process. 
 
-m allows you to specify the path of the file system. 
-l list all signals
-k kill a process
-v verbose
-i to kill a process interactively
- fuser -mv /home/vlateu; fuser -k 345.
6.	QUESTION: There is a droppage in the network, like all the packages are not being sent. What do you do?
-	  I will use mtr (it is a network diagnostic tool used for real time monitoring of networks). It is like a combination of the ping and nslookup command that provides the status of package transfer between 2 devices. It displays package %loss, %sent; and ping %arg, %best, standard deviation, … Then depending of the result, I will implement changes. 

7.	QUESTION: You receive a ticket that it takes long to write to a specific device. What do you do? 
   - I’ll use the `iostat`, `iotop`, or `sar` to monitor disk I/O and identify any bottlenecks or high utilization.
The iostat reports central processing unit (CPU) statistics and input/output statistics for devices and partitions. 
iostat is a computer monitor tool used to collect and show OS storage input and output statistics. It’s used to identify performance issues with local disk or remote disk like NAS storage. 
  
If you receive a ticket or encounter an issue where it takes a long time to write to a specific device (e.g., sdb) in Linux, there are several steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem. Here's a troubleshooting guide:
1. Check Device Health and Availability:
   - Verify that the device (sdb) is accessible and not experiencing hardware failures. Use the `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` command to list available block devices.
   - Check the system logs (`dmesg` or `/var/log/messages`) for any hardware-related errors or warnings.
2. Check Disk Space:
   - Ensure that there is enough free space on the device to accommodate the data you are trying to write.

3. Check Filesystem Health:
   - Use the `fsck` command to check the filesystem on the device for errors. For example: `sudo fsck /dev/sdb1`.
4. Check for I/O Bottlenecks:
   - Use tools like `iostat`, `iotop`, or `sar` to monitor disk I/O and identify any bottlenecks or high utilization.
7. Check for Large Writes:
   - If you are writing a large amount of data, it may take time. Monitor the progress and verify if it's just a matter of the data size.
8. Check for Running Processes:
   - Identify if any processes are causing high disk I/O or contention on the same device. Use tools like `lsof` or `fuser` to find processes accessing the device.
9. **Check for RAID or LVM Issues:
   - If the device is part of a RAID array or LVM setup, investigate the health of the array or logical volume. Use `mdadm` for RAID or `lvdisplay` for LVM.

12. **Monitor System Resources: *
    - Keep an eye on CPU and memory usage. High CPU or memory usage can indirectly affect disk performance.
13. **Update Drivers and Firmware: *
    - Ensure that you are using the latest drivers and firmware for your storage hardware.
14. **Consider Disk Replacement: *
    - If you suspect a hardware issue and have ruled out software-related problems, consider replacing the disk.
15. **Backup Data:
    - Before making significant changes, ensure you have a backup of any critical data on the device.
It's important to approach these troubleshooting steps carefully and document any changes or actions taken. Additionally, always prioritize data safety and backup before making significant changes to storage devices.

8.	QUESTION: What is your experience with extended permissions? I use ACL to assign extended permission to specific users or group over a component. 
Setfacl -m u: root:rwx /home/vanick/textfile.
Getfacl /home/vanick/textfile: to see the permission. 

9.	QUESTION: What do you know about swap files? A swap space is a chunk of storage on the hard drive used to complement the RAM. Swapping is when the Linux kernel uses a hard disk space to store info from the RAM. 
 
-	Swapon: to check swap space.
-	Fallocate -l 1G /swapfile: To create a swap file. A swap file can be extended unlike a swap partition. The command preallocate or deallocate space to a file. -l stand for length.
-	Chmod 600 /swapfile.
-	Mkswap /swapfile: format the file to swap.
-	Swapon /swapfile: enable/activate the swap. 
-	Add it in the fstab for a permanent change.

10.	QUESTION: How would you architecture a VM in ESXi? 
11.	QUESTION: What is the difference between ext4 and xfs?
