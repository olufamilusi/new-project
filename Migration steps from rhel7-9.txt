next, do leapp preupgrade --This check will let you see if there are any config issus before you do the upgrade. Usually there is one or two issues relating to kernel drivers not being compatible with rhel 8 and secondly about a file called answerfile that you need to vi into and uncomment the confirm and change its value to true

vi /var/log/leapp/answerfile (uncomment confirm and write true there)
confirm = True

run the leapp upgrade command again-- to check if issue has been fixed. If you still have kernel drivers error, vi into /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt and rm kernel drivers  which are not supported by rhel 8 by running this command
#modprobe -r pata_acpi
