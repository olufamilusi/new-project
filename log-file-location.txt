HTTP Server (Apache): If you have Apache HTTP Server installed, its log files are typically located in /var/log/httpd/.

These are just a few examples of common log files in RHEL 9. The specific log files and their locations may vary depending on the services and applications installed on your system. You can use commands like ls, less, tail, or grep to view and search log files as needed. Additionally, you can configure logging settings and rotation policies using tools like rsyslog or systemd-journald.
