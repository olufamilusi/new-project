Decommissioning a server involves a series of steps to ensure a smooth and secure process. Below is a general guideline for decommissioning a server:

Document Server Details:
Document important information about the server, such as its hostname, IP address, hardware specifications, installed software, and any dependencies. This documentation will be useful for future reference and auditing.

Identify Stakeholders:
Identify and communicate with stakeholders who may be affected by the decommissioning process. This could include system administrators, application owners, and end-users.

Backup Data:
Ensure that all critical data on the server is backed up before decommissioning. This includes databases, configuration files, user data, and any other information that needs to be preserved.

Notify Users:
Notify users and stakeholders about the planned decommissioning. Provide sufficient notice to allow them to make necessary adjustments or backups if they have data or services hosted on the server.

Update Documentation:
Update any documentation, configuration management databases, or asset management systems to reflect the decommissioning status. This ensures that records are accurate and up-to-date.

Verify Data Backup:
Double-check the backups to ensure that all critical data has been successfully backed up. Verify the integrity of the backup files and confirm that they can be restored if needed.

Remove from Load Balancers or DNS:
If the server is part of a load balancing setup or DNS configuration, remove it from these systems to redirect traffic away from the server.

Update Monitoring and Alerts:
Adjust monitoring systems and alert configurations to account for the decommissioned server. This prevents unnecessary alerts and ensures that monitoring systems accurately reflect the current state of the infrastructure.

Disable Services:
Disable any running services on the server. This may involve stopping web servers, databases, and other applications running on the server.

Remove from Active Directory or LDAP:
If the server is integrated with an authentication system like Active Directory or LDAP, remove its entry from the directory to prevent authentication issues.

Remove from Inventory:
Update the inventory records or asset management system to reflect that the server has been decommissioned. This helps in maintaining accurate records of the IT infrastructure.

Physically Disconnect and Remove:
If the server is a physical machine, physically disconnect it from the network and power source. Remove any labels or markings that identify it as an active server.

Dispose of Hardware:
Properly dispose of or repurpose the server hardware according to organizational policies. This might involve recycling, repurposing, or securely wiping the data from storage devices before disposal.

Document Decommissioning:
Document the decommissioning process, including the date, reason for decommissioning, and any other relevant details. This documentation can be valuable for auditing purposes.

Verify Decommissioning:
Verify that the server has been successfully decommissioned by checking its status in monitoring tools or conducting network scans.

Archive Documentation:
Archive the documentation related to the decommissioning process for future reference. This includes backups, notifications, and any other relevant records.

Following these steps helps ensure that the decommissioning process is well-documented, secure, and minimizes any potential impact on users or the IT infrastructure.

Even small to medium-sized companies have some sort of governance surrounding server decommissioning. They might not call it decommissioning but the process usually goes something like the following:

Send out a notification or multiple notifications of system end-of-life to stakeholders
Make complete backups of the entire system and its data
Unplug the system from the network but leave the system running (2-week Scream test)
Shutdown and unplug from power but leave the system racked (2-week incubation period)
Unracking and palletizing or in some cases recommissioning
The process in the last two companies I worked in, decommissioning was a 30-day process that started with notifications, a so-called "Scream" test, and a final shutdown, unracking, and palletizing for disposal. I love the term "Scream" test. This part of the process involves unplugging the system from the network for two weeks to see if anyone screams about a lost service
