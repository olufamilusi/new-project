1. Make sure to create ssh Keys with ssh-keygen -t rsa on both root and user prompts
Root prompt:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i ; done
Then
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh ; done
Do the same for user engr
su - engr
ssh-keygen -t rsa

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 ; do ssh-copy-id; done

for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh ; done
You should run these commands on both root and user prompts
Make sure


Step1:
First add your managed nodes, contents server and repo server to /etc/hosts file
vim /etc/hosts

192.168.1.101 node1.example.local node1
192.168.1.102 node2.example.local node2
192.168.1.103 node3.example.local node3
192.168.1.104 node4.example.local node4
192.168.1.105 node5.example.local node5

192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

Not: In the exam, you dont need to fill out or add nodes /etc/hosts files on control
node and you also dont need to create ssh-keys on root and user prompts on control node
BUT YOU HAVE TO CHECK content of vim /etc/hosts on control node to make sure that nodes
are added in it and you HAVE TO CHECK that control node can access to managed nodes with
auto ssh from both root (#) and user ($) prompts with for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh; done

STEP2:
IN YOUR LAB ENVIRONMENT
In control node root prompt:

adduser engr on control node
echo 1234 | passwd --stdin engr (1234 is password of engr user)
echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr"

# ssh-keygen -t rsa
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done

create engr user on managed nodes. You dont need to connect to managed nodes to create users.
when you run below commands on control node, you create engr users on managed nodes.
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'adduser engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo 1234 | passwd --stdin engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'cat /etc/sudoers.d/engr''; done
IN EXAM YOU DONT NEED TO CREATE USER LIKE ENGR. YOU DONT NEED TO CREATE SSH KEYS AND COPY THEM FROM CONTROL NODE
TO MANAGED NODES.
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU RUN BELOW COMMANDS ON CONTROL NODE TO MAKE SURE THAT ENGR USER HAS ROOT PRIVILEGES
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE PERMISSIONS ISSUES WHEN YOU RUN ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS

# echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr"
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'cat /etc/sudoers.d/engr''; done

STEP3:
In control node user prompt:
su - engr
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done




İn contro node add managed nodes, repo and content server to /etc/hosts file

İn exam it ask u to get some file from content server with wget
Olu Familusi sent the following message at 11:19 PM

In exam it asks you to get secret file from content server with wget and rekey it


For your lab yıu can give users to 1234 
this command does it
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo 1234 | passwd --stdin engr'; done 
on control node
this command set 1234 password for engr user for all managed nodes
in exam you dont need to do these stsps you do this in your lab environment


take also this information as note for content server
you see there are so many information that you need to learn

I try to help you maybe you will have a new career path after you pass rhce
then you help other people
In my country nobody helped me. People are very selfish here

Here I have to struggle my own like panther to learn everthing and find my way



Download

the answer I gave you includes all these questions
now you should postpone your exam for 1,5 months and work very hard

I used this source
It is enough for u
You will have similar questions in the exam

but there might be some different exams
Work my answers and my notes together
You should work all information that I gave you

install virtual box
on virtual box create node1, node2, node3, node4, node5, classroom, and rghls nodes

the answers in the sample questions document that I gave you few mins ago are wrong so use my answers for those questions

Ok. The one in the PDF is the one i would be working with now since tht has both questions and answers

that is the reason I wrote correct ansible YAML files as they were wrong in the questions document
the answers in the PDF is wrong due to wrongly written YAML syntax. use my answers instead
I see a lot of wrong answers on the different websites i visit for questions. The same playbook they wrote and then i copy it and it doesnt work

match questions in the PDF with my answers



you should install virtualboz and creare this nodes on virtualbox

Yea def....Content file and Repo file...Ok

create a repo server on it
download centos8 on it
create mount point and connect centos8 iso to this mount point

in exam you dont have internet connection. you have to set repo with ansible playbook

but for that you have to create repo server where your centos8 iso is mounted to mount point
two things are important

1. if you dont setup ansible environment correctly
2. if you dont setup repository for managed nodes
you cant pass the exam

you need to guarentee these two first

you cant even pass the exam if you dont setup ansible environment correctly and setup repositories such as BaseOS and AppStream no matter you wrote all ansible playbooks correctly

two weeks before your exam lets do hangout session. you take exam and I will monitor your screen like proctor to make sure that you answer questions in time. You do second lab in the pdf that i gave you
but you should postpone your exam
you are not ready for exam
this way i tell you your mistakes
you will know your weaknesses

My recommendation postpone your exam 8 weeks
work very hard on the asnswer, pdf, and information for 6 weeks
two weeks before the exam, lets do together a hangout session
and you will take the exam according according to lab2 session
from the pdf I gave you

This way I will tell you your weaknesses plus I will give you
some other information that you have to apply them on your lab environment
that you will use for sample exam
can we make hangout session now
I wan to tell you few things

STEP1:

First add your managed nodes, contents server and repo server to /etc/hosts file
vim /etc/hosts

# ssh-keygen -t rsa
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done

create engr user on managed nodes. You dont need to connect to managed nodes to create users.
when you run below commands on control node, you create engr users on managed nodes.
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'adduser engr'; done

# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'cat /etc/sudoers.d/engr''; done

STEP3:
In control node user prompt:
su - engr
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done

Time is important brother
We try to crack the exam to finish on time
We should go to the target with the least effort path !

1. Understanding the question
2. Writing the correct ansible playbook yaml file
3. Runnung it with --syntax-check
4. Making the necessary check after running the ansible playbook
These four things are very important !

We will go through all of thesr 4 steps for each question in the lab
For each questions in PDF and some other questions outside coverage of PDF

Try to insrall centos8 nodes today
Just install
Do nothing special on them

Add node5 1 GB and 2 GB size 2 disks
Dont update nodes after install them
We will do everthing together
Just install 7 nodes that i said u
