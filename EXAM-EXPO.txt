1. Make sure to create ssh Keys with ssh-keygen -t rsa on both root and user prompts
Root prompt:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i ; done
Then
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh ; done
Do the same for user engr
su - engr
ssh-keygen -t rsa

You should run these commands on both root and user prompts
Make sure

Step1:
First add your managed nodes, contents server and repo server to /etc/hosts file
vim /etc/hosts

192.168.1.101 node1.example.local node1
192.168.1.102 node2.example.local node2
192.168.1.103 node3.example.local node3
192.168.1.104 node4.example.local node4
192.168.1.105 node5.example.local node5
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

Not: In the exam, you dont need to fill out or add nodes /etc/hosts files on control
node and you also dont need to create ssh-keys on root and user prompts on control node
BUT YOU HAVE TO CHECK content of vim /etc/hosts on control node to make sure that nodes
are added in it and you HAVE TO CHECK that control node can access to managed nodes with
auto ssh from both root (#) and user ($) prompts with for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh; done

STEP2:
IN YOUR LAB ENVIRONMENT
In control node root prompt:

adduser engr on control node
echo 1234 | passwd --stdin engr (1234 is password of engr user)
echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr"

# ssh-keygen -t rsa
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done

create engr user on managed nodes. You dont need to connect to managed nodes to create users.
when you run below commands on control node, you create engr users on managed nodes.
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'adduser engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo 1234 | passwd --stdin engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'cat /etc/sudoers.d/engr''; done
IN EXAM YOU DONT NEED TO CREATE USER LIKE ENGR. YOU DONT NEED TO CREATE SSH KEYS AND COPY THEM FROM CONTROL NODE
TO MANAGED NODES.
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU RUN BELOW COMMANDS ON CONTROL NODE TO MAKE SURE THAT ENGR USER HAS ROOT PRIVILEGES
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE PERMISSIONS ISSUES WHEN YOU RUN ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS

# echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr"
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'echo "engr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/engr'; done
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i 'cat /etc/sudoers.d/engr''; done

STEP3:
In control node user prompt:
su - engr
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh-copy-id node$i; done
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh node$i; done

One thing i observed tho is that, the user password on the nodes isnt added here... Are you supposed to use the sha512 to generate the password and then input it in this for i statement ....or just ssh into individual nodes to input the password


in exam 
1. you dont need to fill out /etc/hosts on control node
2. you dont need to create ssh keys on both root and user prompts on control node and  copy them from control nodes and managed nodes
but YOU HAVE TO CHECK
if content of /etc/hosts something like that
192.168.1.101 node1.example.local node1
192.168.1.102 node2.example.local node2
192.168.1.103 node3.example.local node3
192.168.1.104 node4.example.local node4
192.168.1.105 node5.example.local node5
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

2. if there is a ssh connection from control node to managed nodes for both root and user prompts

root prompt:
# for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh; done

for user prompt:
su - engr 
$  for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ssh; done

classroom.example.local is your content server
in exam, you might be asked to download secret.yml from content server and rekey it with ansible vault

something like that:

wget http://classroom.example.local classroom/materials/secret.yml
ls
ansible-vault rekey secret.yml
enter current password
enter new password
re-enter your new password




cat /etc/hosts

192.168.1.101 node1.example.local node1
192.168.1.102 node2.example.local node2
192.168.1.103 node3.example.local node3
192.168.1.104 node4.example.local node4
192.168.1.105 node5.example.local node5
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls


here rhgls.example.local, for example, is a repo server
from where nodes install updates and packages

192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls
These two nodes should be on all managed nodes
you can add them after you set your ansible envrionment

by going to each node for example
# ssh node1 and add
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

# ssh node2 and add
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

# ssh node3 and add
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

# ssh node4 and add
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

# ssh node4 and add
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.1.106 classroom.example.local classroom
192.168.1.107 rhgls.example.local rhgls

you should also make sure that ssh is allowed on managed nodes by using below command to check it
firewall-cmd --list-services


---
- name: add repos
hosts: all
become: true

tasks:
- name: add BaseOS repo
yum_repository:
name: BaseOS
description: "CentOS8 BaseOS"
baseurl:  
gpgcheck: yes
gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
enabled: yes

- name: add App Stream
yum_repository:
name: AppStream
description: "CentOS8 AppStream"
baseurl: http://rhgls.example.local/repo/AppStream/
gpgcheck: yes
gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
enabled: yes


create a repo server on it
download centos8 on it
create mount point and connect centos8 iso to this mount point


in exam you dont have internet connection. you have to set repo with ansible playbook

but for that you have to create repo server where your centos8 iso is mounted to mount point
