-----------
Situation
-----------------
Describe the situation
that you were in.

Briefly describe the background to give context to your example. Be specific in identifying a
problem or challenge and provide enough detail for an interviewer to ‘get it.’ Describe the
situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific
event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past.
Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be from a
previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.

-------------
Task
----------
Identify the task that
you set out to
accomplish.
This step might reflect your strategy or thinking in coming up with a plan. What goal were you
working toward?
--------------
Action
---------------
Describe your actions.
What did you do specifically? Which skills did you use? If you were part of a team, focus on you
and the role you played. Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an
appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and
what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group
did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when
describing actions.
-------------
Results
--------------
What happened?
How did the event, project, situation unfold. What did you achieve or learn? How might you do
things differently to improve an outcome? Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy
about taking credit for your behaviour. What happened? How did the event end? What did you
accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.
